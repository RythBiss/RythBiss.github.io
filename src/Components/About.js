      <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h5>Our History</h5>
          <p>
            In 1959, rental store employees Leo Swan and Ed Harding noted that their customers had reoccurring problems when resurfacing uneven concrete floors.  At that time, the ways to level and smooth concrete surfaces were limited to one’s hands or crudely modified buffing machines.  To help their customers, the budding entrepreneurs created the modern day concrete floor grinder.  While this lone grinder was only intended to satisfy their current clientele, news of its existence spread, and wait times for the grinder swelled.  Eventually, with this grinder as their cornerstone, Leo and Ed founded Equipment Development Company, or EDCO –a manufacturer of “Rental-Tough” products.  Today, the Swan and Harding families own and operate EDCO, offering an array of products.
